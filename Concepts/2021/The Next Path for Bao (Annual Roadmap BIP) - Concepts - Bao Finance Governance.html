              <p>It has been nearly 1 year since Bao launched and this community has many accomplishments to be proud of.</p>
<p>As a bootstrapped decentralized community run DAO, Bao has been able to launch multiple products. This is something that not even many VC funded projects can say they did in a year.</p>
<p>We moved faster than others did but slower than we wanted.</p>
<p>We had many successful moments and also lots of learnings.</p>
<p>Now with it being almost the end of the year it is time to take those learnings into new proposals on moving Bao forward.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reminder:</strong> Since Bao is a decentralized community project, all concept proposals are working concepts that get decided upon by the community and galaxy member volunteers. My job in leading the maintainer galaxy is to help propose roadmaps but none of these proposals are final and none have specifics of implementation yet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Redeemable coupon concepts are a bad idea and chew up time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance franchise models are good for testing new technology in an isolated way, but many users struggle to understand this concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We had too aggressive of a farming distribution with BAO and the percent lockup was too high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter how many times you tell people to not do something (and to read docs) they will not do it. So if you want to prevent something or discourage it, it needs to happen in code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good talent is hard to find. They don’t show up from high money offers but passion of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launching on sidechains doesn’t seem to attract automatic liquidity like mainnet does too many sketchy partnerships and incentive deals are what is driving liquidity on those networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things we did:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launched swap prototypes on xDAI with new farms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a secure 1:1 token swap for redeeming Baocx coupons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launched a governance franchise on BSC with experimental governance models rewarding long term locking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launched soft synths on Polygon including $nDEFI token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created custom governance script to allow voting in locked and unlocked governance tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoided any rugs, hacks or exploits despite being unaudited and running 4 products on 4 chains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Built a model for decentralized volunteer teams to build a protocol in a flat model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1) Proposing a shift in Bao’s goal:</strong></p>
<p>Bao started with the goal of being a cross-chain ecosystem of token swaps, baskets/nests, and synthetic assets.</p>
<p>One thing we strongly learned is that it is not possible to do <em>everything</em> by ourselves and that’s how we started to build partnerships with projects like Sushi who already did things like provide strong liquidity on many chains.</p>
<p>I think that it may be good to shift the main objective goal of Bao from just trying to make these protocols simply for end users, to instead make these protocols for teams.</p>
<p>At the end of the day these systems are complex, so while Bao may have its own platform where anyone can create synthetics or nests, it is likely not easy for one person to do.</p>
<p>So Bao’s focus should likely be on building tools that allow any team to easily deploy their own synthetics and nests in a way that uses the Bao ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>2) Proposing changes to Governance and Reward Staking (veBAO)</strong></p>
<p>At current our governance model is innovative but simple. It uses a score of Bao, locked Bao and Bao LP to get a governance score.</p>
<p>As we start to think about how to restructure governance, I wanted to make a proposal that staking rewards (tokens from the other protocols plus tokens the Bao platform generates from use) should be distributed in a way that is merged with a governance score.</p>
<p>There are also many new things we’d want to add to that governance score. So the proposal is to use a design similar to veCRV called veBAO.</p>
<p>veBAO is generated when you stake up the Bao token. The veBAO token is a non-transferable token, and the amount you earn will be based on a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many years you choose to lock in the stake.</li>
<li>How many locked Bao you have from farming.</li>
<li>A bonus % for being an original Bao user.</li>
<li>A bonus % for having voted in Bao governance in the first 6 months.</li>
<li>A bonus % for each of the collectible NFTs you hold (still to be issued).</li>
<li>A bonus % for each of the franchises you’ve used/have locked assets in.</li>
<li>The amount of Bao/ETH LP tokens you have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to our current voting contract, all this math would happen and give you a number of veBAO that you own (it is basically a point score of how much you use the Bao ecosystem)</p>
<p>This number would determine your governance voting power and the amount of staking rewards you earn.</p>
<p><strong>3) Staking Rewards:</strong></p>
<p>One thing we learned is that the model of governance franchises having a proportional share of the token locked in a vault for Bao holders is complicated and not obvious to the Bao holders but we needed a better way to distribute this rather than an airdrop, and not wanting to sell the tokens as they are a governance token.</p>
<p>For this we came up with the idea of staking rewards. Using your veBAO score, on mainnet you’ll be able to claim a share of each of the governance tokens and other rewards dripped out over time.</p>
<p>This way users can actually get their hands on these governance tokens to take part more directly in governance or use them on the platforms for their redeemable use cases like creating Nests.</p>
<p><strong>4) Adjustments to Unlocking</strong></p>
<p>When we designed the unlock curve we expected to have progressed a lot faster towards hard synths and did not have planned the veBAO and Staking Rewards.</p>
<p>Those two changes would mean that the faster locked Bao unlocks, it actually makes it dilute the governance and staking scores of locked Bao users faster than anyone else.</p>
<p>With more than 750M Bao set to unlock each day after the one year mark users would be quick to lock them as veBao for higher total scores than when they were locked the first time.</p>
<p>To prevent this and better flatten the dilution we should push back the <code>lockToBlock</code> by quite a lot.</p>
<p>This was something that did not seem a good idea at the time when locked Bao holders got no rewards and little governance participation. With the change of veBAO users would actually get a high rate of rewards for their locked Bao and so slowing the dilution is helpful to them as well.</p>
<p>Instead of having a fixed number of years for the unlock of locked Bao this proposal would set it to a high number to start (something like 50) and then adjust the number up or down on a recurring basis so that the dilution targets roughly 75% of the Bao that gets used that year in Bao products.</p>
<p>This way Bao is slowly deflationary as a governance token, but long term farmers still get rewards, combat inflation, and get staking rewards and governance bonuses that are not available to other users.</p>
<p><strong>5) Ending Mainnet Farming of Current Pools</strong></p>
<p>This would propose that we end the mainnet farming of the current pools as they continue to give out rewards to mostly empty pools who do not add much value to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Instead we will work on setting up mainnet pools that will reward hard synths once those are ready, and the remaining Bao able to be farmed under the hard cap will be for those.</p>
<p><strong>6) Last Primary Franchise</strong></p>
<p>The governance franchise model has worked well for testing products that we needed to test without being risk to the main Bao ecosystem. But, they have been a bit confusing for users.</p>
<p>Moving forward the Bao community itself will not create new franchises, instead any new products would just incorporate the existing tokens (Bao on mainnet/L2s, Panda on BSC, Polly on Polygon)</p>
<p>But as we shift to making our tools be ones that other teams can use, we will still launch a governance franchise when in partnership with another team. Basically, they would use Bao tech to launch their project and its own token, but a certain amount of the token would have to go to veBAO stakers as a reward for this. We have one possible potential for this already that could be interesting.</p>
<p>This will help simplify things and now that we are done the tests of cross chain and soft synths, the focus is on having Bao be useful.</p>
<p><strong>7) Prioritizing Hard Synths on either Mainnet or L2</strong></p>
<p>We are getting close to having ready a pilot of hard synths and I am proposing focusing the community resources on getting this finalized and live before anything else in our ecosystem.</p>
<p>It may still be a few months before it is ready with a polished front end, but we have code in testing that allows for synthetics to be made and managed with multiple types of collateral.</p>
<p>Unlike the existing competitors who have a separate vault for each position, Bao has a way for you to use multiple collateral types in one vault.</p>
<p>Instead of using a simple collateralization factor like other protocols, the Bao synths calculate collateral value on a curve, where there is a base factor, but the more of a single asset you use the lower its collateral factor becomes.</p>
<p>This means the protocol auto balances liquidation risk if it gets too heavy in a single asset.</p>
<p>The plan would be to launch this on mainnet and L2s, it just unclear to start which launch would be first. We will need to monitor a number of factors.</p>
<p>After the hard synths are launched, we would then devote resources to ensuring the existing sidechain deployments get additional attention and upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>These are all just some proposals being worked on that I hope to include in voting as part of a large ‘annual roadmap’ BIP which would combine our year plan with some other governance clean-up tasks.</p>
<p>The inner details need to be worked out but given all the things we’ve learned and achieved this year, I think this roadmap could set the Bao community up really well for having the full vision of our useful decentralized products even before the new year starts.</p>
<p>Let me hear any feedback you have or things you think we should include in an annual roadmap BIP.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Migrate Bao to new version</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Bao token max cap has too many tokens to work with the detailed math of the current veBAO contract model.</p>
<p>In order to adjust for this we would need to migrate to a new token contract for BAO that would perform a unit split at ratio of 10:1.</p>
<p>Users would have the same percentage amount of total Bao but the units would be smaller.</p>
<p>This may not be required as we could make changes to veBao’s contract instead but it would be ideal.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Begin to implement Governor Alpha</li>
</ol>
<p>This would implement Compounds Governor Alpha and begin to give it control over the various ecosystem contracts one by one.</p>
<p>This would allow for onchain proposals and voting to be directed by any user who reaches a voting threshold.</p>
<p>This is the next major decentralization step in the long term goal of dissolving any official team and having all aspects run by the community through self-organized galaxies.</p>

              <p>Lots if things to discuss here but I would like to say I think the dynamic range unlocking is definitely a good idea. It incentivizes long-term growth and involvement, which hopefully leads to a much stronger ecosystem. If this does not happen there will inevitably be a massive bao dump come December and January which will push people away even if the project is moving foreword at a healthy pace.</p>

              <p>I am somewhat of an amateur in my understanding of the complexity of the entire project so take my comments with a grain of salt but maybe this will help others that are on the same level I am.</p>
<p>My initial feeling is that some of the veBAO factors aren’t really fair or adding value because someone started or knew about Bao earlier.</p>
<ul>
<li>A bonus % for being an original Bao user.</li>
<li>A bonus % for having voted in Bao governance in the first 6 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer the simpler way it’s calculated now but that’s just my preference.</p>
<p>The adjustments to the unlocking seem to be dependent on the proposed changes in the governance and reward staking of veBAO. Is it safe to assume that most of the people that will be receiving the locked Bao as in unlocks are the same people staking it? How does that dilute their governance?</p>
<p>Pushing out the unlocking period to 50 years doesn’t sound appealing. I hope there is some other solution proposed that doesn’t extend the unlocking period.</p>
<p>I have spent considerable funds on transaction costs, impermanent loss and devaluation of the Bao token from when I purchased it with the expectation that the mainnet pools would recover this over time. Especially after holding through this period of the low multiple. I am not keen on the Mainnet pools being ended just as the multiple is about to increase.</p>
<p>As someone with numerous Mainnet pools set up I don’t really understand how to take part in hard synth pools once they are set up with the tokens and coins I already own.</p>

              <p>Overall I feel that alot of these new direction ideas would overall be extremely healthy for the BAO ecosystem, the unlock change would soothe my fear I’ve had for quite along time that the current unlock scheme is far too aggressive and would lead to BAO just being drained. With this we could expect the price and new liquidity entering frequently as long as we can make sure synthetics countinue to work for us, on that note how do we make the synthetics from other teams bring use to BAO? Do we make them host with BAO coins or run through our sites?</p>

              <p>I’m not totally against the Dynamic Range Unlocking as it would be interesting to see the amount of BAO being burned in real time, if there is a prospect of it increasing the unlock time that could be seen as a positive. There should IMHO be a way to drastically reduce the supply permanently over time to support a higher token value.</p>
<p>I haven’t sold any BAO nor am I in a rush to sell any BAO after the unlocking starts and I’m happy to support the project. That’s why I’d like to learn how to take part in the synth pools when they are set up if I can with what I already hold. I think there is an assumption that when the unlocking starts that has to mean dumping of the tokens and the price crashing. The price and market cap are already quite low. If the project is progressing I think many people would continue to hold. People that want to leave will leave and those that see value in the project will buy. Letting the free market run its course isn’t necessarily a bad idea.</p>

              <p>I think we will realize more gains if we introduce new products that burn bao and increase the amount of time for unlock, sometimes people cant be trusted to make the best decisions.

I already have a few thoughts/questions, but will wait until i can give this a more thorough read.</p>
<p>My only immediate suggestion is to expand the amount of time that we have to discuss (eg. Double the usual time) before a vote is held…I dont think this is time sensitive, so expanding this time to discuss should not be an issue.</p>

<p>That’s why I’d like to learn how to take part in the synth pools when they are set up if I can with what I already hold.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is separate from whether these things are a good idea or not.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know how to take part in synth pools when they aren’t live and finalized yet, but just like with all Bao products the community will put plenty of time into making sure there are tutorials so people can participate.</p>

              <p>I was late.<br>
Yesterday I wrote a few thoughts and here I can see Baoman proposed some groundbreaking ideas that are close to me and which I support.</p>
<p>Still, he would share with them.<br>
Sorry for the language.</p>
<p>A few thoughts.<br>
Our BAO token should be the center of our financial galaxy.<br>
The most wanted resource in our universe.<br>
Having a BAO and striving to increase its multiplication plus factors such as the time it is kept in the wallet or the time it is acquired by the pools should bring greater profit for  dedicated participants of the project.</p>
<p>What if in the future, faithful BAO holders would receive a greater percentage of all products that will be made. This could depend on the number of bao tokens and the time of active cultivation.<br>
Three elements of value<br>
QUANTITY<br>
HODL<br>
CULTIVATION<br>
It is worth adding to this by burning tokens.<br>
I wonder how the idea of ​​having bao, in exchange for a greater percentage of the crop, would burn some of its bao tokens, would work in practice.<br>
Another idea is airdrops for owners as part of our new resources.<br>
This is just a small outline of a few spontaneous, probably crazy ideas, so please be understanding.<br>
I dream that in the future our token will become a kind of melange, or “the spice,” as in Dune.<br>
There are many paths of development ahead of us. I trust that our wonderful community will choose the best possible one in its evolutionary cycle.</p>

              <p>On another note I’d like to put in perspective, on the day of unlock there will be 40 billion BAO in circulation, then 750 million each day being unlocked almost a billion every single day for three years. The dilution will be far to much for any realistic mechanism to be implemented to counteract it the price of BAO will crumble to ash.</p>

              <p>Agreed. This is all tied up in speed of progression, and the bottom line (as has been repeated by the team), is that <strong>things take time</strong>. So lock the tokens up for a longer period, because as of today they’re simply “coupons for a future use”. And my experience with the franchises says that if there’s a token in my hands today, I might as well sell it and buy it cheaper later. Finished products (and products burning bao) will change that completely.</p>

              <p>This is something that would still need to be decided, we could probably make a governor contract for this which would allow anyone to call an update() command that would automatically check the amount burned in the last 24 hours and update accordingly.</p>
<p>Things that update on a recurring basis get gamified and frontrun. If you put a person responsible for it, they only update when right for them.</p>
<p>If we make it a contract anyone can call but that only updates on set schedule limit then lots of parties have incentives to make the call so it could be fairly regular.</p>
<p>Other option is to make it specifically not regular and take a long time so it looks at an average.</p>
<p>The community will likely need to run scenarios to decide the best options.</p>

              <p>If the burned tokens are directly related to transactions happening in real time it won’t be gamified because it will be random. I don’t know if this is technically possible but if it is it would create interest to have on the main page. The Eth burn is updating in real time and shows the rate and accumulation of all the Eth burned. It’s pretty cool.</p>

              <p>Burning Bao presented in a form similar to eth is a very good idea. This treatment is mainly of psychological importance and raises the morale of the participants / community. It can also encourage new users to join bao. Such a graphic representation of token smoking plus airdob for base token holders will soon become commonplace in the crypto world. Another trend that I think is coming is the free trade of project NFT tokens with privileges to be used in a given project.</p>

              <p>Let me start by saying I have been involved with BAO basically from day one of launch and have been incredibly impressed by the continuing innovation and dedication of the team. That being said, IMO the recommendation to change the vesting lock-up period scheduled to start ~Dec 2021 over a 3-year period (which was socialized from day one) to an extremely longer vesting period of ~50 years or TBD timeframe is incredibly unfair to those early investors that took the most risk early and may also jeopardize the credibility of the platform moving forward.</p>
<p>Again IMO – the definition of a “fair launch” is to honor the terms of the agreement to those investors providing liquidity and bootstrapping a DeFi platform at launch. To me, early LPs take the place of VCs/seed round investors and shoulder extreme risk with the expectation of a payout if the platform succeeds (per the terms of the agreement at the time capital was deployed). In TradFi and/or DeFi it is unprecedented to change the pre-determined vesting schedule after the fact (2 months away from unlocking) from 3 years which is already a long-term lock-up period for DeFi to extreme-multiple many times more (~50 years), especially considering only 5% of rewards were provided upfront.</p>
<p>To put it simply another way – if the initial LP announcement for launching BAO was to provide liquidity to the BAO platform and get only 5% APY rewards upfront and the remaining 95% vested over ~50 years (or undefined TBD), my guess is there would have been almost ZERO liquidity provided and BAO would not be where it is at today.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind early LPs at launch took on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant risk with an unproven and unaudited DeFi platform</li>
<li>Full exposure to 100% loss, as no insurance coverage on LP positions available (that I’m aware of)</li>
<li>Only 5% of rewards provided upfront (one of the lowest for all DeFi platforms), basically not enough to pay for the extreme gas fees to set up initial LP farms on ETH mainnet.</li>
<li>Spent thousands of dollars on gas to set up LP farms &amp; claim rewards on ETH mainnet</li>
<li>Spent thousands of dollars on gas to move LP liquidity from ETH mainnet to other chains (or because farms were eliminated)</li>
<li>Lost opportunity cost of investing capital elsewhere as LP (where staking/vesting periods are honored). E.g. Sushiswap had a ~6-month vesting period for LPs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now we are being asked/told the potential is the remaining rewards for taking this early risk will be vested over ~50 years or some other undefined TBD period……how is this even remotely fair?</p>

              <p>Its remotely fair because they are making changes to adapt to the current situation, its been almost a year now and as they said they thought they would be abit further on, I am also a early investor and been here the same amount of time and I love the Idea of having a stable and thriving ecosystem. Like its already been stated the 50 years is an example and not the decided time allotting, the idea is that the years will be proportional to the amount of BAO burned. So if the synthetics are very successful it could be 10 years. The point is to make a system that can adapt to whats going on. i.e 75% of annual burns will be sent out to make sure the price is stable and isnt dumped. Keep in mind at this rate at only 3 years we will be adding 750 million coins to circulation every single day overflooding the bao ecosystem and making your loss more and extremely unattractive to new investors as we are now implementing products and potentially ruining everything we have been working for a entire year now. You make it sound like its an arbitrary decision when in fact its a calculated one to make sure we all can prosper and if anything this makes long term investors from the start more money. No offense, but we are at the finishing line now is not the time to let greed and short sightedness ruin us.</p>

              <p>It goes without saying the community involved in the Bao ecosystem are all for a stable and thriving ecosystem. IMO reneging on terms previously promised at the time capital was deployed should be an option of last resort – only after many other options to incentivize hodling/tokenomics via staking, partnerships, profit-sharing from platform fees, treasury allocations, innovations for additional yield and composability, roll out of new products, etc. have been explored, implemented, and proven unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Definitely not a good look for credibility (amongst other things) for the first recommendation out of the gate to renege on promised rewards instead to be paid out at a vesting of 10-years or whatever extremely long-time frame floating around, keeping in mind that only 5% of rewards were initially paid out which as I mention in my initial post most likely did not cover gas fees on ETH mainnet.<br>
The setbacks you allude to IMO are within what is to be expected the “norm” when launching any type of nascent product in DeFi. There have been no hacks or major issues that IMO warrant anything near an initial proposal this drastic. Are you telling me that without even trying a combination of other options, just the potential fear of an incoming dump is enough to do a 180 on the promised reward payout? Name me any successful DeFi platform in existence today that has implemented what BAO is proposing with reneging on the vesting proposal? As an example (one of many), Popsicle Finance was recently hacked within the first month of deployment and nearly 85% of the entire TVL was drained ($20M). At the time of the hack the Popsicle governance token (ICE) was ~$2 and reached a ATL of ~80 cents the week of the hack. Since then, the team has continued to build, come up with innovative solutions for not diluting existing popsicle holders to address repayment of the hack, and even though the platform has been offline for ~over a month with $0 income coming into the ecosystem the governance token has done a ~8x and is now at $6. My point here is, build it and they will come. If people want to sell – let them sell and get a true price floor. The long-term investors of the project can buy the dip and accumulate which should turn into handsome rewards as synthetics and other BAO products hit the market and people recognize the true value of BAO ecosystem (which I 100% believe in or I would not have LP’d to begin with). In another post I’ll try and brainstorm some possible alternatives to incentivize hodling as an alternative.</p>

              <p>There is no good way to deal with 40 billion total coins being flooded with near a billion each day, Its not drastic, its realistic. Nothing is promised, everything can change. We are the project and we can change anything we see fit to suit what we need to continue on. Baoman would work on this project if it was just him, but its better for him to not be stuck in a situation like that and it would be better for all of us for us to be able to keep what we have already so far and build off of it. There was only an initial proposal given to us all. The development team and baoman do not own this project we all do, they make what we vote for they build what we approve we are every bit both investors and workers in this project. That is what we were promised, we werent promised 3 years unlock. That was the initial idea, what we were promised is that we would be apart of a community that builds a project together.<br>
The only reason I can possibly ever think of in this situation of someone wanting to get the 3 year unlock is rushing to grab what money they can and dip, but even that wouldn’t be as fruitful as linking our unlock to burn. If you believe in the synthetics and the products being made you wouldnt be scared of such a system because it means if its successful like you believe it will be then we will get just as many coins, but its important that we do have a safety net to ensure the ecosystem does remain healthy. Why would you opt for a less robust system?</p>

              <p>I do agree changing the terms of the launch after the fact does damage investors who farmed early on. Big bags could front run this BIP and buy bao since these new mechanics will delay inflation and create deflationary processes.<br>
Personally I would approve anything that brings value to the ecosystem and to my holdings/future rewards and overall I think this BIP accomplishes that but early farmers/supporters should be rewarded somehow as they took on enormous market exposure to bootstrap liquidity and farming.</p>
<p>Idea: users can opt in for 50 years and December unlocks take a slashing penalty that can be rewarded to longer stakers or simply burn.</p>

<p>Big bags could front run this BIP and buy bao since these new mechanics will delay inflation and create deflationary processes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are missing the point.</p>
<p>They cannot.</p>
<p>This BIP would delay the unlock but also create new rewards for the farmed locked Bao and give it more voting power, so it is actually worth more than the veBAO which means it overly rewards early adopters and penalizes new whales.</p>
<p>It does the opposite of what you are suggesting.</p>

              <p>You should bear in mind that any locked BAO that the team is due would be subject to the same conditions. That quite clearly puts incentives in the right place - where rewards are dripped based on the success of the products being created.</p>
<p>Personally I would like to see some slight changes in section 2 - changes to Governance and reward staking. The current suggestions are mostly focused on what has already happened and don’t really incentivize ongoing participation in the DAO.</p>
<p>My suggestions would be to add the ability to get more boosts to rewards via NFTs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being active on discord</li>
<li>Use of BAO products</li>
<li>builders (pull requests accepted, or community tools makers)</li>
<li>referrals</li>
<li>bounties</li>
<li>ongoing governance participation</li>
<li>BIP proposal accepted</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is implemented, over time we will see the most active members of the community, who contribute the most to the success of the ecosystem being rewarded with a larger share of staking rewards while diluting rewards for “free riders”</p>

<p>Idea: users can opt in for 50 years and December unlocks take a slashing penalty that can be rewarded to longer stakers or simply burn.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Personally, I’m happy to delay expected rewards/token unlocking in favour of BAO’s economics working optimally. I like the idea mentioned above as a way to appease any early participants who insist on being paid for their liquidity as had been originally planned.</p>
<p>I’m noticing as well that a few people seem to be hung-up on the mention of 50 years lock-up, so perhaps it would be helpful to emphasise how this could change after a few months.</p>

<p><strong>5) Ending Mainnet Farming of Current Pools</strong></p>
<p>This would propose that we end the mainnet farming of the current pools as they continue to give out rewards to mostly empty pools who do not add much value to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Instead we will work on setting up mainnet pools that will reward hard synths once those are ready, and the remaining Bao able to be farmed under the hard cap will be for those.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When you say this do you mean the Bao will be farmed with synthetics?</p>

              <p>Below is a DRAFT brainstorm of options that IMO makes concessions on the part of LPs who were expecting a 3-year linear token unlock at the time of deploying capital on the BAO platform while also focusing on the long-term success and alignment of incentives for all community members. The tokenomics may not be 100% accurate and are used for purposes of providing a baseline example &amp; estimate (info from coingecko, Baoman posts, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On day one of unlock (or as soon as boost incentives for term lockups, staking, synthetics and/or other alternatives to incentivize long-term hodlers of BAO are released) – provide an airdrop of 3% ($24B BAO) of the estimated total locked BAO. The BAO airdrop would be on a time-locked vesting over the period of 1-year to be claimed at the user’s discretion. After the airdrop, $24B BAO would be burned or removed from the amount owed to LPs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the nominal amount of BAO tokens (compared to the original 3-year linear vest) to be airdropped is to reimburse LPs (within a 12-month period) for fees &amp; expenses incurred when setting up and claiming rewards on ETH mainnet, bridging liquidity to xDAI, etc. IMO there is a misunderstanding that early LPs made a killing and are significantly up in profits, which from my experience is not the case. Only 5% of rewards were claimable and many LP pools included high-risk altcoins with significant IL. This IL risk is 100% the investor’s responsibility, but the decision to enter these high-risk IL pools was based on the expectation of BAO rewards being distributed over a 3-year linear unlock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 3% airdrop represents ~33% of the current circulating supply and given the time-locked release over 12 months and available options to provide yield should not adversely impact the token price long-term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2A) Initial Dynamic Range Unlocking – Set the lock range for ~10 years</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a slightly inflationary dynamic range unlocking mechanism. The daily unlocks would always roughly match the burn plus a nominal additional unlock.</li>
<li>Example: the initial starting range could be 1:1.15 range to 1:1.25 range</li>
</ul>
<p>2B) Revise Dynamic Range Unlocking based on achieving pre-determined milestones/metrics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: At a burn rate milestone of (X) % total BAO, or (X) $ burned increase the dynamic unlock rate at 1:1.25 range to 1:1.5 range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the next milestone of (X) % total, or (X) $ burned increase the dynamic unlock rate at 1:1.5 range to 1:1.75 range.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, the BAO ecosystem and corresponding token should become more valuable with a first-mover advantage &amp; growing synthetic asset adoption, increased partnerships, and other innovative DeFi products/franchises bringing additional value accrual to the BAO token. As this progression occurs, a higher TVL &amp; token burn should allow for a higher $$ valuation and support an increase in the price to earnings ratio which should allow the ability to absorb a greater token inflation model via increased BAO unlocks (e.g., Curve token).</p>

              <p>Ok. So I have finally gave this a few reads and digested the proposal best i could. There is a lot going on in this request, so I will speak on what I believe to be the main items of discussion: governance &amp; staking rewards.</p>
<p>I am not fully clear on the repercussions of implementing this proposal, so I will focus on asking questions and providing my thoughts in this post.</p>
<p>Governance &amp; Staking</p>
<p>This proposal plans to move governance “power” from the current Bao token to the proposed veBao token.</p>
<p>As i understand it, we are being asked to stake our Bao, both hodl Bao and any Bao that is due to unlock (which would be significantly decreased due to the proposed changes to unlocking = 75% of Bao used/burned when using Bao products ) to veBao.</p>
<p>Questions/Thoughts (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>how does xdai fit into this? I assume baocx can be swapped 1:1 to Bao and then bridged to mainnet for more voting power and used in whatever products are created?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why would a current Bao holder surrender his/her voting power that they currently enjoy, to a new token that has a new criteria to calculate voting power?</p>
<pre><code>    - gamifying this voting power only adds risk to current Bao holders. Sure, current Bao holders can increase their voting power if they are more aggressive than the others, but why even bother...what do they get out of it (as opposed to status quo)?

    - their voting power can even be reduced if they do not meet the requirements of the new criteria.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>why would a Bao holder forego their right to claim the FULL amount of their daily unlocked tokens in a few short months, to claiming a REDUCED % of those tokens over a much longer period of time?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i understand that a large amount of tokens are due to be released (750 million as per Baoman), which may be sold off causing a decrease in price…but could we not put other things in place to increase the utility of the token (eg. products, regular staking)?</p>
<ul>
<li>why is a decreased price perceived as negative? An opportunity for those that want the token?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>matching dilution to “roughly 75% of the Bao that gets used”…this is a very vague statement. If the uptake of the products that “uses” Bao is minimal, these locked tokens could be locked for a VERY long time. Using Polly as a comparison and its burn mechanism, does not provide me with much confidence that enough utility will be derived from the products that will be launched on Bao mainnet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a decision on whether or not to support this proposal, i would need concrete numbers to evaluate which path is better…unfortunately, getting these numbers is impossible, as these products that “uses” the Bao token are yet to exist.</p>
<p>Ultimately with the information provided so far, i cant see a reason to support this proposal in its current form.<br>
I would not want to give up my current level of voting power and move to another voting structure where it could result in me having reduced voting power.</p>
<p>I also do not want to give up my right to claim my locked tokens as per the original format, where i have the flexibility to use the tokens as i choose…whether its sell in the market or put to use in any new products that is to be offered on mainnet (eg. Staking). This proposal will reduce the flexibility, with a longer lockup…and this amount of time is unknown.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>3) Staking Rewards:</strong></p>
<p>One thing we learned is that the model of governance franchises having a proportional share of the token locked in a vault for Bao holders is complicated and not obvious to the Bao holders but we needed a better way to distribute this rather than an airdrop, and not wanting to sell the tokens as they are a governance token.</p>
<p>For this we came up with the idea of staking rewards. Using your veBAO score, on mainnet you’ll be able to claim a share of each of the governance tokens and other rewards dripped out over time.</p>
<p>This way users can actually get their hands on these governance tokens to take part more directly in governance or use them on the platforms for their redeemable use cases like creating Nests.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So do the rewards come from the treasury? Sorry, doesn’t completely seem clear to me.</p>
<p>Also, about the veBAO/unlock business. What are the specifics for the formula for calculating staking rewards? Putting aside the question of fairness, I suspect this vote will not pass without the vote of large locked bao whales. The veBAO formula for increased staking rewards will likely need to be very aggressive to convince them to vote in favor of this proposal, the curve formula of a maximum of 2.5x boost I feel will likely not suffice.</p>
<p>Also, I think people are overly worried about the unlock. Bao marketcap has fell 75%-90% from ATH. To some extent, though maybe not fully, the unlock is already priced in.</p>

<p>Well simply because some do not have extra funds to buy more BAO and/or we believe this to be a way healthier model for the BAO ecosystem. I’m not here to grab cash and run I want this project to succeed.</p>

              <p>Im not so sure about the airdrop, airdrops I have no idea on how proven on effectiveness they are. But I think we should take your dynamic range ideas and put them as additional options for the vote for sure! I still personally like the longer range option. Because I think if we allow price to increase that’ll eventually achieve the same thing of a shorter lock time like 5-10 years because there will be so many burns going on. Thank you for such a well written counter proposal.</p>

              <p>I don’t think the airdrop would be possible as you described it - its not possible to change the amout of tokens that are each wallet has locked.</p>
<p>As I understand it, there is only one parameter that can be changed - the amount of time the tokens will take to unlock. if we wanted to achieve a faster unlock at the start we could set the unlock period to a very short time until the correct number have unlocked then increase the unlock period again.</p>
<p>I think this defeats the purpose of the proposal though - the idea is to unlock tokens in a more controlled manner to help provide more value to the ecosystem as a whole, including locked BAO holders. The sacrifice for achieving this is to delay the gratification of receiving BAO tokens.</p>
<p>Changing the unlock rate to an inflationary model would be possible.</p>
<p>Personally I feel a deflationary model will work better overall though because a deflationary token will mean that over time governance tokens given as a reward will represent a larger share of the project, helping to create a positive feedback loop where greater rewards provide a larger incentive to use products, which will lead to more usage and more burning. This is the key factor for me that I think a lot of people have not fully considered.</p>

<p>why would a current Bao holder surrender his/her voting power that they currently enjoy</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Current BAO holders would be restructuring the voting power to align more with what benefits the project long term. For example, holders that lock BAO for a short time will have less voting power than those that lock for a long time. This reduces the ability to buy votes or for large holders to coordinate on forcing through decisions that are not in the long term interests of the project. Vitalik covers these problems and others in this article: <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html" class="inline-onebox">Moving beyond coin voting governance</a></p>

</aside>
<p>I would describe it as more of a trade of smaller short term rewards for larger long term ones. Don’t forget the proposed mechanism allows locked tokens to realise value continuously in the form of staking rewards on top of the BAO that unlocks.</p>

<p>i understand that a large amount of tokens are due to be released (750 million as per Baoman), which may be sold off causing a decrease in price…but could we not put other things in place to increase the utility of the token (eg. products, regular staking)?</p>

<p>Products are being built as fast as they can be. But the situation now is that we are not as far along as we had originally hoped for a number of reasons (<a href="http://gov.bao.finance/t/learnings-from-bao/681" class="inline-onebox">Learnings from BAO</a>) &amp; although full synthetics are expected to have an MVP released in Q4, we will not be burning as many tokens as was hoped. So we have to make a decision on whether to act on that or not, and if we do act, what will it look like.</p>

</aside>
<p>Governance tokens are used as rewards. A lower price means less effective incentives for using products, which could lead to less usage and less burning. We want to try to create a positive loop rather than a negative one.</p>
<p>On top of this, a heavily inflating token will incentivize selling, which will make it much easier for a single party to buy a controlling share of the protocol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>matching dilution to “roughly 75% of the Bao that gets used”…this is a very vague statement. If the uptake of the products that “uses” Bao is minimal, these locked tokens could be locked for a VERY long time. Using Polly as a comparison and its burn mechanism, does not provide me with much confidence that enough utility will be derived from the products that will be launched on Bao mainnet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If the uptake is minimal then the situation will not be good regardless of whether tokens are unlocked or not. unlocked tokens will have little value if they have little utility or burning etc. I’m not sure its fair to expect the burning on Polly to have much of an impact yet considering there is one MVP and the token is heavily inflating while it is distributed to the community. Once there are more nests, the platform is fully open for others to create their own &amp; inflation dies down the situation will eventually change. Burning &amp; development should continue long after the initial distribution ends. The community can also propose and vote for any changes they want that they think will help.</p>
<p>Having unlocking linked to the burn rate puts incentives for the team in a good place too - tokens are only unlocked when products are adopted</p>

              <p>It has been stated already but thought it worth saying one more time. Changing what was promised for the early liquidity providers &amp; stakers is wrong. Those saying “its best for the community” are likely people who didn’t pay the fees and provide the liquidity. While I was staking I was not able to vote on many community decisions that impacted the liquidity I was providing because my BAO was in LP. Now, again those not in LP are deciding what happens for those providing LP? This is the worst decentralized project is that is the case. There was no confusion or uncertainty on what was going to happen as the unlocks started, the dilution has been known.</p>
<p>We’re heard over and over that decisions are not made for the current price. Well this sure sounds like decisions are being made for the current price.</p>

              <p>I have paid fees, and lost money. And I think this is the best way forward, its not changing what was promised because 3 year unlock wasn’t a promise. Doesn’t even make sense if we didn’t have money in here why would we care if it went down or want for liquidity to stay stable? The problem is now price is an issue because with a price drop this severe and flood of BAO entering the system without diversified holders harms the security of both governance and the protocol at large. Do you have any alternative ideas or proposals?</p>

<p>Here is also my proposal or observation directly tied to this concept</p>
<h1>
<a name="my-personal-adjustments-or-observations-to-the-concept-1" class="anchor" href="#my-personal-adjustments-or-observations-to-the-concept-1"></a><strong>My personal adjustments or observations to the concept</strong>
</h1>
<p>Here is a list of things I would like to point in this proposal. I understand the “how” is not defined in most of the text, especially for the veBAO calculation, but I am writing them for transparency and for the benefit of everyone</p>
<p><em>A clear objective for the BIP</em></p>
<p>When moving this concept to BIP, the sought objective should be clear. Ex: This proposal seeks to reach agreements with the community on the direction the project should take in the next year. Individuals proposals would be held afterward so we can agree on the specific parameters and tokenomic.</p>
<p><em>A little difference in the unlock schedule for xDai users</em></p>
<p>We all know Bao Coupons are bad. This is a harsh lesson learned while undergoing our xDai journey. As we cannot bridge native xDai tokens to main net and that on-chain data cannot look at contracts from different L2 solutions, it would be extremely difficult to bring Bao.cx locked amount to the veBAO power calculation.</p>
<p>xDai users can only exchange their BAO coupons to BAO and bridge them back to main net in order to stake them, to be considered in the veBAO calculation</p>
<p>My suggestion would be that xDai Bao unlocks rate be always 50% faster than main net unlock rate to account for this problematic.This would give the opportunity to xDai users to stake their unlocked BAO at a faster rate on main net to be able to profit from veBAO. Locked BAO coupons could also be added as part of the voting strategy on Snapshot.</p>
<p><em>Beware of accumulating bonuses</em></p>
<p>% Bonuses shouldn’t be too high, especially if they are compounding.</p>
<p><em>Open question : Shall we continue to give incentives to Bao liquidity pool ?</em></p>
<p>I am concerned about BAO liquidity if there are no incentives for months on BAO/ETH pools. Having UNI and Sushi pools as the only ones still giving BAO rewards could be considered, or those pools be integrated into other protocols or the possible new franchise proposed.</p>

              <p>Reposting from my Discord post</p>
<p>Wow, only been away few days and so much happened. The truth is that if unlocking happens as per current schedule, the price is likely to go down.  That’s for everyone who is locked for the next 3 years. It’s going to crash everyone whether you were early or “late” (still think we are all early)</p>
<p>I only came here in April and missed early Bao days so for myself I have maybe 20M (+10M on xDai Bao.cx) so price going down does not bother me that much if community decides to leave it as is. It bothers me it can destroy the protocol beyond repair (takeover or simply de-motivate community). Been part of PandaSwap and Polly and like where we are heading.</p>
<p>I love veBao concept and already own other veTokens. The tokenomics for Bao, fixes to PNDA &amp; RHINO (launch synths),  finalising franchises governance and working on new products is way more important to me than the current price (for that I have invested in other tokens).</p>
<p>I understand some people frustration however I am not sure if they realise that zooming out can help. Bao performance in one Year has been amazing, releasing locked tokens might temporarily work for a short time, but would hurt many in the long run unless there is a way to lock these tokens for other rewards imho.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing discussion other than token price, there is very little we can do with it directly, we can only influence it indirectly via various ideas and building more products.</p>

              <p>After some consideration about the reasons given I have come to think that the dynamic range unlocking is a good idea and should be implemented. The sooner this is done will hopefully add some stability into the price.</p>
<p>If changes are made to the mainnet pools perhaps a portion of them that aren’t adding much return should be the ones to be removed. The Bao/Eth pools need support and should be getting a much higher ROI than they are paying out now. I hope to see some of the mainnet pools remain until the end of the farming period or at least until the synth pools are up and running.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>5) Ending Mainnet Farming of Current Pools</strong></p>
<p>This would propose that we end the mainnet farming of the current pools as they continue to give out rewards to mostly empty pools who do not add much value to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Instead we will work on setting up mainnet pools that will reward hard synths once those are ready, and the remaining Bao able to be farmed under the hard cap will be for those.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So when you say this does it mean that we will be farming the rest of the BAO under the hard cap with synthetics? Also could we possibly keep a few pools that rewards auto compound? Ones like maybe BAO/ETH make a new one BAO/RAI you know like, of course ones that are important to keep around.</p>

              <p>I don’t totally buy the “BAO unlock will crash price” theory. As someone said earlier it may already be priced in. Why? Consider that it’s very possible the large BAO whales have already hedged their locked BAO in cex perp markets already. SOL is an example of this “bullish unlock”. Just my two cents, I haven’t looked at short interest metrics or anything to quantify the amount of hedging that has taken place</p>

              <p>I think this was presented in a somewhat confusing manner… I love the idea but it was a misstep to explain it the way it was…</p>
<p>I think Baoman summed it up perfectly here. “It would mean tokens release over longer scales but are worth more if the protocol has a slow growth curve, but if the growth curve is fast then tokens could in theory unlock faster.”</p>
<p>This idea is more akin to what Ethereum is doing with its burning mechanism… its as simple as the more we use the products provided by the Ecosystem the quicker our Bao will be unlocked…and the inverse is true. its not at all about a specific time frame…I think we should refrain from expressing it as the unlock will be indefinitely elongated.</p>
<p>I’m curious about the actual rate of burn. is it simply a offset? or can we tilt it so that we’re hyper deflationary for a while and then it tapers as we reach a sustainable dilution rate? I guess this is a question for the big brains</p>
<p>veBAO sounds awesome!</p>

              <p>For me (if there is a mechanism) and unlock is proportional to protocol usage makes perfect sense. More usage more unlock, less usage less unlock. Setting up parameters may be challenging</p>
<p>Still think introducing veBAO together with the above is a great option as I dont mind to lock tokens for another few years. Would love if I could take my locked tokens (3 years) and convert to veBAO (locked for max time) to earn incentives.</p>

<li><strong>About shifting focus.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I am happy that Baoman realises that we cannot be everything ourselves. We are running a real risk of making the best an enemy of the good. I really like the concept of ​​shifting focus to building tools that allow any team to easily deploy their own synthetics and nests in a way that uses the Bao ecosystem. The hard question will be why would other teams use Bao instead of a plethora of offerings already in the market, for example I really like DPI’s Index and have also been a  supporter of them (though not as much as I like Bao, honestly). The teams  building on Bao will ask for incentive, do we want or have incentives to offer? If yes we should work with one or two INDEPENDENT teams  to build something.</p>
<p>I also think the theme is more about FOCUS rather than shifting focus, and that also relate to Bao project itself (more so).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>About proposing changes to Governance and Reward Staking (veBAO) and staking rewards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I support that and given then veCRV and xSUSHI has succeeded implementing, we have an easier time convincing holders. And staking rewards go hand-in-hand.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>About adjustments to Unlocking</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you saying that instead of allowing unlocking in December, users supposedly-unlocked tokens in December will be autolocked to become veBAO token? This is an absolutely NO . Not only does this kill the initial agreement, it also gives a very bad vibe that the team is deferring the pressure (and responsibility) to a later time period, and this time from 4 yours to a much longer 50? years.</p>
<p>The price of BAO tokens matters less to the trajectory of bao.finance than most think, even if BAO tokens tank you will still have the support of loyalist and you can still build a great product. So please  don’t break  what you promise and alter the code. A wise person <a class="mention" href="/u/trader">@trader</a> said that the definition of a “fair launch” is to honor the terms of the agreement to those investors providing liquidity and bootstrapping a DeFi platform at launch.</p>
<p>There is also a misunderstanding that the early comers made a killing. I am a so-called whale got in in December 2020 the upside wasn’t as great to be totally honest. I also provided BAO pairing liquidity which significantly reduced my earnings if I only held onto BAO. Lastly we all could be spending time on other projects but the fact that we are spending time here shows our faith in it so please guys like <a class="mention" href="/u/jester">@Jester</a> give us a break.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>About ending Mainnet Farming of Current Pools</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Agree. There are even incorrect pools so the better we end it the better.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>About prioritizing Hard Synths on either Mainnet or L2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Super excited - really, regardless if it’s on Mainnet / L2 / other side-chains. Is there anyway supporters can test it? Even at code-level (without fancy UIs) that would give alot of optimism.</p>

              <p>I’m in general fine with extending the vesting period. Maybe not quite 50 years, but something longer than 3 might make sense. If everyone just dumps their tokens starting in December then puts a damper on the whole project.</p>
<p>Also agreed on the thoughts that focus should be on the product. Product and protocol revenue with create demand for the token and that is where the long term value will come from.</p>

              <p>I think you have misunderstood the adjustments to unlocking.</p>
<p>When BAO unlocks you would be free to do what ever you like with it. One of the options you have is to lock it up again to continue receiving staking rewards and voting power. locked BAO would receive this by default - a huge benefit of the proposal to locked BAO holders, which seems to be largely glossed over.</p>
<p>The 50 year timeline is just a fallback/maximum timeline that would be sped up by the burning of BAO. The idea is for each BAO burned, 0.75 would be unlocked. Hopefully the full amount of locked BAO would be unlocked <em>well</em> before 50 years. Its possible (although unlikely) that the BAO could even become unlocked quicker than 3 years using this structure too. It all depends on the success/adoption of BAO products.</p>
<p>Changing the unlock schedule where the owners of locked tokens are the ones voting for it isn’t really going back on an agreement because it the choice of those token holders. I could understand the argument if that was not the case, but we are simply giving them the option of a different structure, not forcing it on them.</p>

              <p>I think the 50 year maximum is really a hard pill to swallow for too many. Would it be that much different to just say 10 year max? Most of the other items in the BIP seem to be tolerable to mostly everyone.</p>
<p>I think 50 scares people. Why have that in there unless you think it is a possibility? Some Bao holders will literally be dead in 50 years.</p>
<p>I would suggest officially stating a lower number than 50 years because as long as that is there it remains a big distraction to this discussion.</p>

              <p>All I have been stating is that by making changes to the original plans is not breaking promises or misleading investors, from the very start everything was always subject to change the only thing that will most likely remain the same by the end is the fact that we are all building a project together and that this will always be a community lead project that was the only promise. If something changes its because the community decided thats the appropriate way forward, so your argument is not fair even if any of the original plans changed it would still be honoring the terms.</p>

              <p>Hello BaoFriends.  December is nearly upon us.  I believe BaoMan’s proposals are a good, pragmatic approach to making the best of a sub-optimal (i.e. bad) situation.  I’m not a dev, not uber-crypto-experienced, and my bags are not nearly sizeable enough to make any difference in any eventual voting, but I feel strongly enough about the project and its potential to continue trying to learn and participate in the community.  I say all this only to offer that there may well be a worthwhile, non-zero amount of folks who are kinda like me (i.e. embarrassingly crypto new but doing their best) and who may be disproportionately intimidated or put off by the 50 year figure.  My comprehension of the fine details of the situation are in no way sophisticated or learned, but in general newbie terms I see that unfortunately the December unlock period is happening way earlier than the product launches that BaoMan and all had hoped to be in place by now, and we need something to counteract the resulting impending dilution.  I agree with the concept of a new formula that adjusts unlocking to a proportion of annual burn, but as a practical matter, the issue of revising the proposed unlock mechanism is a BIG deal, and I strongly feel that BaoMan and the team should revise/supplement/clarify/specify this proposal significantly in order to gain more buy-in and to alleviate concerns.  For such a significant change, there should be a much more detailed presentation of what is proposed and how it would work, with some examples so folks can understand.  The text of the proposal says “Instead of having a fixed number of years for the unlock of locked Bao this proposal would set it to a high number to start (something like 50) and then adjust the number up or down on a recurring basis so that the dilution targets roughly 75% of the Bao that gets used that year in Bao products.”  Again, I agree in general with the concept, but I can’t tell precisely what mechanics are proposed here.  Does this mean that the unlock will still start in December but the proportion/term of the unlock will be adjusted?  How would this be calculated?  If the calculation is based on how much Bao gets used “that year” then during Year 1 of this adjustment is the burn measured and recalculated on a monthly basis?  Quarterly basis?  Daily basis?  What is the proposed formula?  Again, I agree with the overall concept, but I feel that the few lines presented so far are not enough to engender confidence in those of us who are not on the core team, whales and uber-insiders.  If more info is provided, showing the proposed formula, then folks can get their brains around what is being proposed, and it also helps to sell the benefits of the plan and folks are less likely to focus on the 50 year bit.  Of course, perhaps I’m a newbie and this issue will be determined by the whales anyway, but I feel that BaoMan and the team have made an effort to speak to all community members, even those of us with less than 1B Baos, so my biggest comment is this:  I know it sucks, but December is here…I know the team is working on projects, but if we really are going to vote on a new roadmap and unlock mechanism, then I think it is in the best interests of the team and the project to do a WHOLE lot more to supplement and detail the proposed mechanics, and show that the proposed mechanics have been carefully thought out and will work as intended.   And if it is necessary to say 12 or 25 years instead of 50 years in the proposal in order to not spook the newbies (if their votes really count) then fine, but for sure give more examples of the mechanic so it is clear that the proposal has been fully thought out and is a mechanism that will deliver what is intended.   Many thanks to the BaoMan and the team.</p>
<p>PS I only just now saw BaoMan’s response to Jester’s question: ( <a href="http://gov.bao.finance/t/the-next-path-for-bao-annual-roadmap-bip/865/18" class="inline-onebox">The Next Path for Bao (Annual Roadmap BIP) - #18 by Jester</a>) and my followup to BaoMan’s response is:  When would these mechanics be figured out?  After the Annual Roadmap BIP vote?  What would the timing of that be relative to the current unlock start date?  It is my sense that it would be optimal (if not essential) that these mechanics be figured out before the start of the current unlock schedule, but there does not appear to be sufficient time to accomplish this.  At the current pace, it could take months to figure out a mechanism and vote on it after the Annual Roadmap BIP as currently formulated, right?  And by that time the Great Dilution is already under way, no?   Again, I’m in no way intending to sound critical of BaoMan, I’m just trying to get my noob brain around what appears to be a big event occurring and not fully comprehending how BaoMan’s proposal can be implemented successfully/timely to mitigate the dilution.  Thanks to Wolf, Chickn etc if there are clarifying wise words that could set this clearly.</p>

              <p>Dear BaoMan:  I like your suggestion/response here but the December unlock is nearly upon us and I am concerned that if the BIP proposal goes to a vote in December just before the scheduled unlock and it takes another 3-4 months to “decide” figure out and otherwise finalize the actual mechanics, then the Great Dilution will already be under way.  Sadly, I lack the technical kung fu to formulate a proposed mechanism.  Would it be possible for you and the team to add to your draft/revisions to the formal BIP some mechanism with greater detail so this is clear and folks won’t be scared off by the 50 year figure?  I posed a longer comment on this issue below but thought I’d just reply to your comment here to flag my thoughts in this issue.  I like the concept of the proportional dynamic range unlock and I think it is probably the best we can do under the circumstances, but for the sake of the entire Bao community I would like to see the proposal supplemented/revised with a more detailed, functional mechanism set out up front so we know how this will work from Day 1 of the Great Unlockening.  Again, I apologize for lacking the tech kung fu to know how to formulate a proposal/mechanism myself or I would have done so rather than sounding like someone saying “hey do more work”.  I just wanted to articulate my thoughts on the urgency of putting a more defined and functional mechanism proposal into the BIP proposal asap if at all possible.  Thanks and much appreciation.</p>
