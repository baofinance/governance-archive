We believe this concept encapsulates the essence of Bao Finance, including our brand’s origin, mission, vision, and the values we stand for. It’s a reflection of our journey, our commitments, and how we differentiate ourselves in the dynamic world of DeFi.</p>

<h2><a name="baos-promise-1" class="anchor" href="#baos-promise-1"></a><strong>Bao’s Promise</strong></h2>
<h3><a name="aside-from-trying-to-sell-a-product-or-service-why-do-we-do-what-we-do-2" class="anchor" href="#aside-from-trying-to-sell-a-product-or-service-why-do-we-do-what-we-do-2"></a><strong>Aside from trying to sell a product or service, <em>why</em> do we do what we do?</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine a game where one team knows all the rules and secrets, and can change them whenever they want. Institutions have access to financial data and regular people dont. And when things dont go their way, they change the rules of the game. Thats how Legacy finance, with its closed and opaque systems, is skewed against the everyday person.</p>
<p>Bao wants to level the playing field by democrotizing access to financial data, giving everyone easy access to the same kind of financial information that institutions have. This way, everyone can play the game with the same knowledge of the rules.</p>
<p>We’re committed to creating a financial world that is open, clear, and fair for everyone.</p>
<h3><a name="who-or-what-are-we-making-a-commitment-to-3" class="anchor" href="#who-or-what-are-we-making-a-commitment-to-3"></a><strong>Who or what are we making a commitment to?</strong></h3>
